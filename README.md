## JCT 2020 Hackathon
In Hanukah, during the COVID19 virus, my partners and I create an easy way to check the "Eruv" (עירוב), 
which encompasses cities with a Jewish population.
Our solution combines a hardware and software - a server which gets in real time, from a power sensor,
the status of every piller and piller in every city. 
From the website that you can find it interface here, the Religious Council of each city can send a man to fix the problem in the excatlly piller,
instead of sending men to search around the whole city for a rift in the "Eruv"
