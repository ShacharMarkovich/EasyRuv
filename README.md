## JCT 2020 Hackathon
In Hanukah, during the COVID19 virus, my partners and I created an easy way to check the "Eruv" (עירוב),
which encompasses cities with a Jewish population. Our solution combines hardware and software - a server which gets in real-time,
from a Power-sensor, the status of every pillar and pillar in every city.

From the website, that you can find it interface here, the Religious Council of each city can send a man to fix 
the problem in the exact pillar, instead of sending men to search around the whole city for a rift in the "Eruv".

### `npm install`

In order to install the necessary packets.
